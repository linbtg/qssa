# QSSA
Automates Export, Duplicate and Reload actions via keyboard shortcuts.

## Description:
Qlik Sense Shortcut Actions is a powerful browser extension designed to enhance your productivity while working with the Qlik Sense QMC interface. With this extension, you can streamline repetitive tasks by using custom keyboard shortcuts to perform common actions such as exporting, duplicating, and reloading apps.

By automating these actions, this tool eliminates the need for time-consuming manual navigation and clicks, allowing users to focus on what matters mostâ€”analyzing and managing data.

## Features:
###Keyboard Shortcuts:

Use customizable shortcuts to trigger specific actions directly on the Qlik Sense QMC interface:
Alt+Shift+E: Export the selected app.
Alt+Shift+D: Duplicate the selected app.
Alt+Shift+R: Reload the selected app.
## Seamless Integration:

The extension integrates directly with the Qlik Sense QMC application and enhances the existing functionality without disrupting your workflow.
## User-Friendly Design:

No additional setup is required. Once installed, the extension works out of the box and listens for shortcuts while you're on the Qlik Sense QMC app management page.
## Efficient Workflow:

Save time and clicks by automating frequently used actions, especially useful for power users and administrators handling multiple applications.
## How It Works:
Navigate to the Qlik Sense QMC apps page.
Use the defined keyboard shortcuts to perform actions without searching through menus.
The extension interacts with the app's UI to find and click the relevant buttons, mimicking user actions seamlessly.
## Privacy & Permissions:
The extension only requests the permissions required to function, ensuring your data and browsing activities remain secure. It operates exclusively on Qlik Sense QMC pages (*://*/qmc/apps*) and does not collect or store any personal information.

## Why Choose This Extension?
If you're a Qlik Sense administrator or a frequent user of the QMC, Qlik Sense Shortcut Actions is an essential tool to boost your efficiency. Simplify complex workflows and spend more time focusing on data insights rather than repetitive tasks.
